# Smartwifi™
Smartwifi™ provides control of many home, buisness and industrial "smart wifi" applications such as Smartwifi™ LED lights and Smartwifi™ Thermostats. Each device has it's own wifi server that can be clusterd or controlled on line. All devices use point to point encryption, in order to avoid spyware, so that companies who forward your data, (to mobile devices and computers) do not have access to the status or configuarion of your device (such as Honeywell). Devices are self reliant and OpenSource so that companies (such as Honeywell) cannot turn your $100+ device into Vaporware or Spyware.
